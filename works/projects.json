Through the interlocking of spaces, we were able to play with spatial versatility that encourages interaction in creating these intimate corners.",

The BRYCG (New Orleans cuisine) and MINU (Japanese cuisine) can be found on the First Floor. Followed by The Deck (Rooftop Lounge & Bar) placed strategically on the Second Floor. A multipurpose courtyard exists in front of the structure that serves as a parking lot during weekdays and a farmers' market on the weekends.\n\nInspired by the Japanese fish market, the Kuroshio Market stands out among others in contrast with the farmers' market; due to its expressive use of raw jute ropes and fishing nets (elements commonly found in fishing villages) influential in its theme of design. The market also consists of a bakery, a florist and a cafe.",
      "middle-description": "The name MINU was taken from a renowned Japanese proverb - 'Minu ga hana'. The phrase translates as 'not being seen as a flower'. It's true meaning may take variations of sorts, however it could be narrowed down into an implication that states 'ignorance is bliss'. The Japanese believes that things are never as they seem; or rather what we imagine it to be. Therefore, to try and analyse what is would be an exercise in futility, as imagination will never compete with reality.\n\nThe idea behind BRYCG stems from reflecting on the culture found in New Orleans. The scene found on the under side of a bridge is elemental in capturing the dining ambience of New Orleans; made possible by placing a sequence of steel arches along the dining area. Hence the name 'BRYCG', an abbreviation of sorts at the word-play 'Bridge'.\n\nThe Deck, on the other hand, is a rooftop lounge and bar extended from the BRYCG. This alfresco dining area provides an open view to the surrounding of the site.",

Hence, our design is dealing with very narrow - less than 10’ width space after minus off the walls and structures.",

To further visually extend the space, the house is designed to appear as “light” as possible with the choices of light colour finishes and thin metal structures. Plenty of openings are also utilized to ensure the house is well lit with natural daylight. \n\nOn the front facade, the multi-decks structure is created with cat ladders so that the mezzanine study deck is connected externally to the bedroom above. This deck also functions as a floating garden for the house, with potted plants and creepers growing on the decks and screens.",

      "description": "Communal Living, a Social Experiment \n\nKuala Lumpur downtown is now experiencing a doughnutised effect, a phenomenon of city dwellers slowly moving out from city centre. One of the main reason is undoubtedly high property value vs affordability of house buyers, this swift of migration of the city dweller to the outer city creates emptiness at the city centre district. We believe, one way to reverse this trend is to create affordable houses that paired up with well thought urban planning, good urban design and interesting programmes, to attract people to move back to the city centre. \n\nWith much optimistic we anticipate the public transport would be improved and with the popularity of uber and grab \ncars, city dwellers in the future are less dependent on private cars as commuting means, thus car parks become excessive and can be opted for different usages, eg. micro housing for this instance. Our design solution focuses on a mere 2 parking plots size (measuring 2.5 x 5m x 2 nos) on a hypothetical car park site owned by DBKL, with this in mind a design grid system of 2.5 x 5 is formulated. From there on, excessive car park plots will slowly be replaced by micro houses, driveways gradually turned into open place, green belts and bike lanes, unused car park plot in between houses can be adopted and turn into vegetables planting beds and various form of public space. This group of houses, in time, will grow into a urban micro village.",

A secondary steel frame conservatory membrane is inserted into the existing glass membrane, spanning over to demarcate the dining areas in within, while allowing necessary intensity of daylight to penetrate  through. \n\nThe volume within is framed by continuous skin of glass wall, allowing necessary levels of daylight into the interior spaces while serving as a lens open outwards to the lushes of green. Not just the greens, one could simply appreciate the best view of Exchange 106 Tower while enjoying a wide range of main course, pastries or even just sipping a standard cup of coffee. Customer is served underneath a conservatory structure within the building structure itself, in par with the initial idea of preserving surrounding trees as a part of its structure.",

      "description": "The Duo Duplex is a three storey house built using the concept of interlocking multiple duplex blocks to form a singular construct.\n\nMaterials were engaged in a raw sense to exaggerate the duality of the complex; each material was chosen and formed accordingly to the idea present in each individual floor. The ground floor portrays as a solid base, wherein the idea of rigidity was conveyed through the utilization of raw concrete, clay bricks and exposed services. The first floor on the other hand, expresses a lighter void revolving around transparency. It was achieved using glass, steel cables and wire mesh. Each floor delivers a story of its own, shaping a type of conflict as if one found in a story book.",
      "middle-description": "Duplex 01\n\nHousing the ground floor and the rear side of the first floor, the first duplex consists of a kitchen, living room and 2 en-suite bedrooms with baths. It is accessible through the front yard and a backdoor on the opposite side. The unit functions on its own as a studio and is connected to its subsequent with a stair core made of black steel sheet facing towards clear tempered glass; this not only allows high permeability of daylight, but also helps convey a sense transparency.\n\nDuplex 02\n\nAccessed through a flight of stairs, the second duplex encloses the front side of the first floor and its attic above. Parts of the duplex include a kitchen, living room that connects to a balcony, a mezzanine sleeping deck, an en-suite bedroom with a bathtub, and a roof garden. The layout of this unit is more structured in comparison to the duplex below. The doors, when folded to the sides, connects the living space with the kitchen revealing a larger space allowance. In compensation to the land's neighbouring borders, an additional floor was added in order to fit the third bedroom. The second duplex is also accessible through multiple access points that are separated from the preceding unit, this was done with the intent to make the house more user-friendly.",
