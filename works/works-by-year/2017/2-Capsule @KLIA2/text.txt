project-type: Hospitality
team: xxx
location: KLIA2
project-year: 2017

description: The Capsule Hotel is an eco-friendly, green and sustainable dwelling provided for travelers at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2.

The Capsule project explores the potential of cost-efficient sustainable homes, concurrently testing its limitations. Inspired by the modularity, flexibility and the adaptable values of shipping containers, a design was drawn that bridges a contrast between the sophistication of the systematic airport and the recreation of one's cozy room.

middle description: Construction materials were recycled, disassembled, reassembled and utilized wherever necessary. The Capsule conforms to the modular construction method, wherein each capsule was fabricated singularly off-site; by doing so, it has reduced the time, energy and cost factor in the production process. The green approach in this method was aimed towards achieving Tetawowe's belief of the potentiality of container homes as a sustainable solution.
