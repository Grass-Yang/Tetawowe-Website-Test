description: An indoor sunbathing dining experience - a cafe interior with a home sunbathing experience
Sunbather is a retail cafe that centred around a fictional character - Mr.O who loves sunbathing at home. It is located amidst the hustle and bustle of a retail complex. The cafe splits into a few intimate sections, the bar, the side seatings, centre communal tables and the indoor decking..
By engaging subtle lights and shadows, the interior is being enlivened through warm timber textures, bright yellow tiles as well as white canvas that drapes over, initiating an indoor sunbathing experience. Local artisan has been invited to work on the feature trellis screen and chairs that is made of pvc-rubber string weaving, to complete the sunbathing experience under tropical sun
