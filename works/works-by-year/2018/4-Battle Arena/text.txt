Repeatable steel module frame are designed to fulfill a flexible construction (in-situ / prefab). These steel modules form PC rooms and spectators corridor on the mezzanine level. The nature of the skeleton-like module makes space for service ducting; provides possibility to create futuristic and industrial features by exposing services like LAN cable, electrical cable and aircond.
