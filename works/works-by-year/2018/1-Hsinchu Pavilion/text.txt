description: This project speculates the basic necessities and the potential modes of a dwelling by using the idea of ‘Core’. Core is the simplest form and a singular entity that represents the simplest programme, consisting only the entrance, living area, room and toilet. By exploding these spaces like an axonometric drawing, the space is now appeared as a cluster of singular units with their own distinctive programme, having negative spaces in between. 

The ‘explosion’ of core  negative space is being captured in physical form, allow inhabitants to have more possibilities of dwelling. Archiblur, a Taiwanese Architecture firm collaborated throughout the design process to explore and actualize this project together as one of the architecture installation exhibited at Hsinchu Park Follies 2018.
